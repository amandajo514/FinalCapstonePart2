### Executive Summary

As the dedicated data analyst at our influencer representation agency, I've analyzed datasets to extract key metrics that drive brand impact and marketing success. Through a meticulous process of EDA and interactive visualizations in Tableau, we've identified crucial performance indicators shaping influencer scores, setting the stage for strategic influencer engagement and revenue amplification.

### Steps Taken: Cleaning, EDA, & Modeling

Commencing with the merging of datasets, my approach involved rigorous exploratory data analysis using Python, Seaborn, and interactive visualizations in Tableau. Distributions, count plots, and box plots unveiled nuanced insights, culminating in a comprehensive Tableau story, providing a deep dive into influencer stats and rankings.

### Conclusions

While the U.S. dominates influencer concentration, top influencers consistently lead in engagement metrics, emphasizing the direct impact of likes, comments, views, posts, and followers on overall performance. Uncovering the lack of direct correlation between 60-Day Engagement vs Followers and Influencer Score vs Rank highlights the multifaceted nature of influencer success.

### Recommendations

- *Diversified Strategies*: Beyond traditional metrics, explore innovative content, collaborations, and community-building for enhanced impact.
- *Geographical Expansion*: Expand influencer representation globally to diversify portfolios and tap into varied demographics.
- *Collaborative Marketing*: Leverage the impact of top influencers by strategically grouping those with high stats in various categories, increasing overall visibility.
